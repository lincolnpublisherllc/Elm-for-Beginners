README — Elm for Beginners: Extracted Code
What you’re getting

A ZIP with folders named chapter_1, chapter_2, … and so on.

Inside each chapter folder you’ll find files named snippet_001.elm, snippet_002.elm, etc.

I saved code with the most suitable extension:

Elm code → .elm

HTML pages → .html

Shell/terminal commands → .sh

Small code-like fragments that aren’t clearly Elm/HTML/CLI → .txt

How I detected and grouped code

I parsed your DOCX and scanned every paragraph for Elm patterns like module, import, type alias, case, Browser.sandbox, view :, update :, and common library calls like String.* and List.*.

HTML snippets were detected by <!DOCTYPE html> and <html>.

Commands like elm repl, elm make, elm reactor, npm install, brew install, etc. were saved as .sh.

Snippets are grouped by the chapter heading they appeared under. If a long code example was split by regular prose in the book, you’ll see it as multiple sequential snippet_### files for that chapter.

Quick run guide

Most Elm snippets are minimal, self-contained examples you can paste into src/Main.elm of a new Elm project.

Create a project

mkdir my-elm-playground
cd my-elm-playground
elm init


Add a snippet
Open one of the .elm files from a chapter and paste the code into src/Main.elm.

Run with reactor (great for learning)

elm reactor


Open the printed URL in your browser and click into src/Main.elm.

Or compile to JS

elm make src/Main.elm --output=main.js


Create a small index.html (several chapters include a sample) and load main.js.

Notes on accuracy and edge cases

The book mixes code, commands, and prose. I used careful heuristics to avoid dragging in normal sentences as code. Still, if you see a .txt that looks like prose, it’s likely a very short, code-like fragment that wasn’t clearly Elm or shell.

If any example was shown in multiple small blocks separated by explanation, you’ll see them as separate snippet_### files. Combine them if the context in the book shows they belong together.

The ZIP mirrors the book’s flow. If you follow the chapters in order, the snippets should line up with the examples and exercises you described. 

Elm for Beginners

What I extracted (high level)

Chapter 1–3: Hello World, counter examples, inputs with validation, and the basic TEA pattern

Chapter 2: Many CLI examples for elm repl, elm make, elm reactor, and elm init, plus simple project files and an HTML loader

Chapter 3+: Progressive Elm examples for Model, Msg, update, view, pattern matching, lists, records, modules, and debugging tours

Later chapters: More Elm snippets and some HTML scaffolds for embedding

If you want me to rename files based on example names in the text, or separate CLI vs Elm into dedicated subfolders, say the word and I’ll reorganize it.
